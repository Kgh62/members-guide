Cleaning and Improving the Space
================================

**The Hackspace is run, cleaned, organised, and maintained by every Hackspace member.** One of the best things to do as a member is to clear-up just a little bit more mess than you may make, that way the space is more usable for everyone and continues to look good.

Work-surfaces that are regularly used, such as the benches in the workshop & the large table in the blue room, are designated as clear zones. Please make sure to clear these areas after working on them.
